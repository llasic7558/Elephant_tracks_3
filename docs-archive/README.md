# Documentation Archive

This directory contains **original markdown files** that have been consolidated into the new `docs/` structure.

## Why These Files Are Here

These files were previously scattered in the root directory. They have been:
- **Consolidated** into comprehensive guides in `docs/`
- **Archived here** for historical reference
- **Replaced** by better-organized documentation

## New Documentation Location

All current documentation is now in **`docs/`** with this structure:

```
docs/
├── getting-started/     # User guides
├── implementation/      # Technical details  
├── development/         # Bug fixes and analysis
└── reference/          # Specifications
```

## Migration Guide

See **`docs/MIGRATION.md`** for a complete mapping of old files to new locations.

## Finding Content

**Instead of reading these archived files**, please use the new documentation:

- **Getting started** → `docs/getting-started/README.md`
- **Merlin details** → `docs/implementation/merlin.md`
- **Logical clock** → `docs/implementation/logical-clock.md`
- **Architecture** → `docs/implementation/architecture.md`
- **Bug fixes** → `docs/development/witness-fix.md`
- **Oracle building** → `docs/development/oracle.md`
- **DaCapo usage** → `docs/reference/dacapo.md`
- **Trace format** → `docs/reference/trace-format.md`

## When to Use This Archive

Only reference these files if:
- You need the exact original wording
- You're tracking historical development
- You want to see interim analysis documents

For current usage, **always use `docs/`**.
